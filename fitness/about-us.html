							<h3 class="adapt_heading">The adapt way of life</h3>
							<p class="adapt_text">We are very proud to be a non-intimidating gym; with a diverse membership base -
								from singles, to families, to seniors. We are open 24X7 and offer world class,
								top-of-the-line equipment. We realize you have many choices available when it
								comes to fitness and we'd like to take the time to thank you for allowing us to
								present some information concerning our business. Having been involved in the
								fitness business for several years, we became increasingly frustrated at the poor
								standards in our industry.</p>
							<p class="adapt_text">Quite simply we became sick and tired of clubs where sales numbers were more
								important than member results, and good training programs and qualified
								instruction were almost impossible to find. We set out to create the solution. That is
								why we are here today. Adapt Fitness is a new high energy, state-of-the-art fitness
								center Adapt Fitness is your alternative to large, impersonal gyms. We focus on
								relationships with our members, customer service that exceeds expectations, and
								individualized fitness program design to help you get the most out of your
								membership. We are a gym that caters to people who have never been in a gym
								before, those who need to update their workout experience, and those who are
								serious about getting great results! All our memberships include a personalised
								training. We have various memberships available for people needing nutritional
								guidance, fitness assesments, or sports specific training.</p>
							<p class="adapt_text">We believe we have the best fitness club in the area with the most cutting edge
								training methods and a clean and comfortable workout area. We also believe we
								offer many types of modern fitness training, such as TRX Training, Rip Training, Boot
								Camp Workouts, Kettle Bell Workouts, Functional Training, Zumba, Power Yoga,
								Pilates. What truly sets us apart from the rest of the Fitness Clubs. You can come in,
								meet with one of our fitness experts and spend 3 days trail with us and see if our
								club is for you, without any risk or obligation. More importantly - we are the only
								fitness facility whose sole focus is not on membership numbers â€“ but on our
								members</p>
							<p class="adapt_text">Exercise needn't be boring. There are so many different ways you can be active that
								not liking the gym is no longer a good enough excuse to avoid it. Granted, there
								was once a time when exercise was sitting on a stationary bike, pedaling slowly
								whilst staring at a wall, but not anymore. Gym exercise variety is huge! We don't all
								like the same things, and that is why the Apple fitness is pushing boundaries, striving
								to appeal to our members. If you don't like weight training in a traditional sense, try
								kettlebell training.</p>
							<p class="adapt_text">Gyming is no longer boring and tiring, with Apple Fitness you get to enjoy your
								favorite fitness programs like TRX Training, Rip Training, Boot Camp Workouts, Kettle
								Bell Workouts, Functional Training, Zumba, Power Yoga, Pilates.</p>
